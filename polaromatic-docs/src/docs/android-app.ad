== Android Application

While I was developing the backend I thought that it would be great to be able to take a photo with the phone an
_Polaromatize it_. So I made the changes to the backend to be able to receive a photo and then I create an Android
application to send the photo.

With this application you can take a picture with your phone, add the text you want and then share it with the
Polaromatic web.

This is my first Android application and it has been fun to create it using Groovy.

TIP: Please be sure to configure in the _Settings_ option the url in which you have deployed your Polaromatic server or
use the default demo environment.

NOTE: The application is only a _share-app_ so it is not shown in the applications list after you install it.
