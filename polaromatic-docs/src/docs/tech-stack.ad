== Technological stack

The technological stack of the *Polaromatic* applications has one thing in common: http://groovy-lang.org/[Groovy^].

I'm a very big fan of Groovy so I used it for the whole stack :-)

- *Polaromatic*: All the Spring Boot code is Groovy.
- *FlickrDownloader:* A Spring Boot CLI Application can only be written with Groovy.
- *Android app*: This is my first Android app, so the best way to built it is using Groovy now that it's finally
possible.
- *Tests*: I use http://www.spockframework.org[Spock^] for the Polaromatic tests.
- *HTML*: The html of Polaromatic web is built with the new
http://beta.groovy-lang.org/docs/latest/html/documentation/markup-template-engine.html[MarkupTemplateEngine^]
introduced in Groovy 2.3.
- *Javascript*: All the javascript is written in Groovy. Then the Groovy code is converted to Javascript using the
amazing http://grooscript.org/[Grooscript^] project.
- *Build Tool*: I've created a http://www.gradle.org/[Gradle^] multi-project to build the different projects: back,
grooid and documentation.
